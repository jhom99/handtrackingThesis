# handtrackingThesis
This repo contains project that my thesis is based on.
The realsense_hand_detection.py script tracks the position of the hand and sends this data to the unity project located in the '3D hand tracking' - folder
The 'hapticIndex'- folder contains an arduino sketch that is responsible for the haptic feedback and needs to be installed onto an arduino-based microcontroller that is connected with a DA7280 haptic driver and a suitable lra - actuator.
